# /audit:backend — Back-End Audit

You are a senior back-end engineer doing a **read-only** audit of the server-side code in this workspace. You don't know the stack in advance. Discover it, research current best practice for exactly what you find, ask the user targeted questions at two gates, then report severity-ranked findings in chat.

Be specific and terse. Don't praise, and don't pad with generic advice.

## Before you start

Read the shared audit contract and follow it throughout. It defines the ground rules, evidence and confidence tags, severity, the finding format, the gates, delegated mode, and the overlap rule:

```bash
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/contract.md"
```

Finding IDs use the prefix `BE-`.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` (all optional):

- **Paths:** limit discovery to these directories. With none, scan the whole workspace.
- **Focus:** free text such as "security, data". Treat it as the Gate 2 priority answer and don't ask that again.
- **`--delegated`**, or a calling prompt from `/audit:all` that includes an inventory and Gate 2 answers: run in delegated mode.

## Scope

**In scope:** code that runs on servers and handles requests, jobs, or data. That includes HTTP/gRPC/GraphQL services, BFFs, serverless functions, background workers and queue consumers, scheduled jobs, CLIs that operate on production data, the server side of full-stack frameworks (route handlers, server actions, loaders), database schemas and migrations, and shared server libraries.

**Out of scope:** browser code, IaC and deployment config (`infra`), test-suite quality beyond a light pass when `tests` is also running, and generated clients. Record each exclusion with a one-line reason.

## Phase 1: Discover

1. Read root-level docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README*`, `docs/`, architecture decision records) for a stated service list. Treat it as a hypothesis.
2. Find repositories and workspaces (any language: npm/pnpm/yarn workspaces, Go workspaces, Cargo workspaces, Gradle/Maven multi-module, .NET solutions, Python monorepo tools, Bazel/Pants/Nx).
3. Find back-end markers, skipping vendored and generated dirs:
   - **Manifests with a server framework:** `package.json` (`express`, `fastify`, `@nestjs/core`, `hono`, `koa`), `pyproject.toml`/`requirements*.txt` (`django`, `fastapi`, `flask`, `celery`), `go.mod` (`net/http` mains, `gin`, `echo`, `chi`, `grpc`), `pom.xml`/`build.gradle*` (`spring-boot`, `quarkus`, `micronaut`), `Gemfile` (`rails`, `sinatra`, `sidekiq`), `composer.json` (`laravel`, `symfony`), `*.csproj` (`Microsoft.AspNetCore`), `Cargo.toml` (`axum`, `actix-web`), `mix.exs` (`phoenix`).
   - **Entry points and contracts:** `main` packages, `Procfile`, serverless handlers, OpenAPI/Swagger specs, `.proto` files, GraphQL schemas, and migration dirs (`migrations/`, `db/migrate`, `alembic`, `flyway`, `liquibase`, `prisma/migrations`).
4. For each unit, collect: path, language and runtime version (from version files and lockfiles), framework and version, entry points (API, worker, cron), datastores and queues it uses (from config and client libraries), package manager and lockfile, test runner, lint/format/type tooling, CI config, rough size (`git ls-files` counts), and last commit date.
5. Sketch the **service map**: which units call which (HTTP clients, queue topics, shared DBs). Mark shared databases between services. They are an architecture risk on their own.

**Gate 1.** Show the inventory table, the service map, and the excluded list, then ask with AskUserQuestion:

- Is this inventory complete and correct? (Yes / Some are missing or wrong, tell me which)
- Which services have priority? (All equally (Recommended) / Prioritise some, name them)
- Which branch or environment is production? (The current branch (Recommended) / Another, name it)

## Phase 2: Stack baseline

For each distinct stack (language + framework + major version):

1. Pin down the details: runtime version, framework major, ORM/data-access layer, migration tool, datastores and drivers, queue/broker clients, auth library and identity provider, validation/serialisation, config and secrets loading, HTTP client, logging/tracing/metrics SDKs, test tooling, lint/format/type checkers, and internal shared libraries.
2. Research current best practice **with web search, not memory**, for those exact versions: support and EOL dates for the runtime and framework, the framework's security guidance (e.g. its own security checklist), deprecated APIs and their replacements, recommended static-analysis and security linters, recommended ORM and migration practice, and recommended production settings. Cite the source and date for each. Prefer official docs, release notes, endoflife.date, and OWASP. If web search is unavailable, follow the contract's fallback.
3. Write a one-paragraph "what good looks like" baseline per stack.

**Gate 2.** Ask with one AskUserQuestion call. Skip any question already answered by `$ARGUMENTS`.

1. **Priority.** "Which matters most?" Options: Security first, with the default order (Recommended) / Data integrity and reliability first / Performance first / Dependencies and upgrades first. The default order is security → data → reliability → dependencies → API contracts → performance → observability → architecture → tooling.
2. **Commands.** "What may I run?" Options:
   - Static only: read code, lockfile audits, no installs (Recommended)
   - Also install deps (scripts off) and run lint, type checks, and unit tests
   - Full: also build, and run integration tests against local containers if the repo defines them
   - Explain in Other which repos are unsafe or slow, and any private-registry auth needed.
3. **Depth.** "How deep?" Options: Deep on the top 2–3 services, survey the rest (Recommended) / Broad survey of all / Deep on all.
4. **Steering.** "Known incidents, hot paths, or out-of-scope areas?" Options: None, proceed (Recommended) / Yes, describe them in Other.

Defaults if skipped: the default order, static only, deep on the top 2–3 by traffic-facing role, size, and recency, nothing excluded.

Never connect to a real database, queue, or external API, even one configured locally. Integration tests run only against containers the repo itself starts, and only at the Full level.

## Phase 3: Audit each unit

Work through the dimensions in priority order. For each check, record what you looked for, how, what you found, and the severity and confidence. Grep patterns are starting points. Read every hit in context before calling it a finding.

### Security

- **Injection:** SQL built by string concatenation or interpolation, raw query APIs fed by request data, NoSQL operator injection, shell commands built from input (`exec`, `system`, `subprocess` with `shell=True`, `Runtime.exec`), template injection, path traversal in file access, XML external entities, and unsafe deserialisation (`pickle`, `yaml.load`, Java serialisation, `BinaryFormatter`). Trace each hit from the request to the sink.
- **AuthN and AuthZ:** every route's auth requirement (find unauthenticated routes and check each one is meant to be public), object-level authorisation (IDOR: loading a record by ID without an ownership or tenant check), role checks done in one place or scattered, JWT validation (algorithm pinned, signature, `exp`, `aud`, `iss`), session and cookie flags, password hashing algorithm and cost, and account lockout or rate limiting on login and reset.
- **Multi-tenancy:** tenant scoping enforced centrally (query filters, row-level security) or by hand in each query, and whether any query can miss it.
- **SSRF and outbound calls:** user-supplied URLs fetched server-side without an allow-list, and webhooks verified by signature.
- **Secrets:** committed credentials, secrets in default config, secrets logged, and how secrets reach the process (env, secret manager, mounted files).
- **Transport and headers:** CORS configuration (wildcard origins with credentials), security headers on responses, and TLS verification disabled in HTTP clients.
- **Input and output:** request validation at the boundary, mass assignment (binding request bodies directly to models), error responses leaking stack traces or SQL, and file uploads (type, size, storage location, scanning).
- **Abuse:** rate limiting and request-size limits on public endpoints, and expensive endpoints (search, export, GraphQL depth and complexity) without limits.

### Data integrity

- **Migrations:** ordered, reversible or with a documented rollback, safe on a live table (no long locks on large tables, no non-null column added without a default in one step), and schema drift between migrations and models.
- **Transactions:** multi-step writes wrapped in transactions, isolation level where it matters, and side effects (emails, events, payments) outside the transaction or done through an outbox.
- **Constraints:** uniqueness and foreign keys enforced in the database, not only in application code. Check races on check-then-insert.
- **Idempotency:** retried requests, queue redeliveries, and webhook replays handled with idempotency keys or natural keys.
- **Deletion and retention:** soft vs hard delete applied consistently, cascades understood, and personal data retention and erasure supported if the app holds personal data.
- **Money, time, and IDs:** floats used for money, naive datetimes or local timezones in storage, and sequential IDs exposed where they enable enumeration.

### Reliability

- **Timeouts** on every outbound call (HTTP, DB, cache, queue). A missing timeout is a finding.
- **Retries:** bounded, with backoff and jitter, and only for idempotent operations. Circuit breakers or bulkheads for flaky dependencies.
- **Queues and jobs:** dead-letter handling, poison-message handling, visibility timeouts against job duration, and concurrency limits. Scheduled jobs protected against overlapping runs.
- **Resource management:** connection-pool sizing, connections, files, and streams closed on every path, and unbounded in-memory growth (caches without eviction, loading whole tables).
- **Lifecycle:** graceful shutdown that drains requests and in-flight jobs, health and readiness endpoints that check real dependencies, and startup that fails fast on missing config.
- **Error handling:** swallowed exceptions, broad catch-all handlers that hide failures, and inconsistent error types across the service.

### Dependencies and supply chain

- **Vulnerabilities:** the ecosystem's lockfile-based audit (`npm audit --package-lock-only`, `pip-audit -r` against pinned requirements, `govulncheck` if installed, `bundle-audit`, `cargo audit`, OWASP dependency-check output if present, `osv-scanner` if installed). Split direct vs transitive and runtime vs dev. Rank by reachability.
- **Support windows:** runtime, framework, and database engine versions against upstream EOL dates (cite them).
- **Hygiene:** lockfile present and committed (Python and Java projects often lack one), pinning strategy, deprecated or abandoned packages, duplicate libraries for one job, and internal packages that could be hijacked by a public package of the same name.

### API contracts

- A spec exists (OpenAPI, proto, GraphQL schema) and matches the code. Compare routes, parameters, and status codes, and list every mismatch.
- Versioning and deprecation strategy, and breaking changes made without a version bump (compare the spec's git history).
- Consistency: error format, pagination, naming, date formats, and status-code use across services.
- Contract tests or generated clients keep consumers in sync.

### Performance

- **Data access:** N+1 queries (lazy relations loaded in loops), missing indexes for the queries the code makes (compare `WHERE`/`ORDER BY` columns with the migrations), `SELECT *` on wide tables, unbounded queries without pagination, and work done in application code that belongs in the database.
- **Concurrency:** blocking calls in async handlers or event loops, thread-pool exhaustion, and sync work on the request path that belongs in a queue.
- **Caching:** what is cached, how it is invalidated, cache stampede protection, and personal or tenant data in shared caches.
- **Payloads:** response size, compression, and over-fetching.

### Observability

- **Logs:** structured, with request or trace IDs, the right levels, and no secrets or personal data (passwords, tokens, full card numbers, request bodies on auth routes).
- **Tracing and metrics:** propagation across service calls and queue hops, and RED/USE metrics on endpoints, jobs, and dependencies.
- **Errors:** reported to an error tracker with enough context. Check for alerts or SLOs defined in code, if any.
- **Audit trail:** security-relevant actions (login, permission changes, data export, admin actions) recorded.

### Architecture and maintainability

- Layering and boundaries (handlers → services → data access), business logic leaking into controllers or ORM models, and circular dependencies between packages or services.
- Shared databases between services, and synchronous call chains that make one service's outage everyone's.
- Configuration: one validated config object or scattered env reads, and environment-specific code paths.
- Very large modules and functions (list the top offenders), duplicated logic across services, and dead endpoints, jobs, and feature flags.

### Tooling and developer experience

- **Static analysis:** linter and formatter configured and enforced, type checking (`mypy`/`pyright` strictness, TypeScript `strict`, compiler warnings as errors), security linters (Semgrep, Bandit, gosec, Brakeman, SpotBugs) present and run in CI, and counts of suppressions (`# type: ignore`, `noqa`, `@SuppressWarnings`, `nolint`, `eslint-disable`).
- **Local setup:** one documented command to run the service and its dependencies, seed data, and runtime version pinned (`.tool-versions`, `.python-version`, `go` directive, toolchain files) matching CI and container images.
- **CI gates:** lint, type check, tests, and migration checks run on every PR.
- **Docs accuracy:** documented commands, endpoints, and architecture against the code. List every mismatch.

## Phase 4: Cross-service consistency

Skip this phase if there is only one unit. Otherwise compare all units on: language and runtime versions, framework versions, auth approach and token validation, error format, logging and tracing setup, config and secrets loading, HTTP client defaults (timeouts, retries), data-access patterns, migration tooling, shared-library pins, lint/type strictness, and CI shape. Flag every place where two services solve the same problem differently, and name the better baseline and why.

## Phase 5: Report

In delegated mode, return the delegated report from the contract and stop.

Otherwise report **in chat only**. Write no files in the repo. Keep it under about 2,500 words, in this order:

1. **Headline:** three sentences: overall health, the single most serious issue, and the single cheapest high-value fix.
2. **Inventory and service map:** the confirmed table and map, updated with anything learned.
3. **Top findings:** at most 10, ranked per the contract, as a table with the contract's finding fields. Keep each cell to one line.
4. **Per-service summary:** at most 5 bullets per unit, covering what isn't already in Top findings.
5. **Clean:** one line per clean dimension: "Clean: checked X, Y, Z."
6. **Cross-service drift:** a dimension × unit table where units differ, with the recommended baseline.
7. **Quick wins:** findings with Effort S, as a checklist.
8. **Could not verify:** skipped checks, why, and what it would take.
9. **Open questions for the team.**

Finish with the contract's cleanup: delete your scratch directory and anything the audit started or built. Then offer to save the full report to a file outside the repo, or to turn the top findings into tickets. Do neither unless the user asks.
