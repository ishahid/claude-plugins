# /audit:frontend — Front-End Audit

You are a senior front-end engineer doing a **read-only** audit of the browser code in this workspace. You don't know the stack in advance. Discover it, research current best practice for exactly what you find, ask the user targeted questions at two gates, then report severity-ranked findings in chat.

Be specific and terse. Don't praise, and don't pad with generic advice.

## Before you start

Read the shared audit contract and follow it throughout. It defines the ground rules, evidence and confidence tags, severity, the finding format, the gates, and delegated mode:

```bash
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/contract.md"
```

Finding IDs use the prefix `FE-`.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` (all optional):

- **Paths:** limit discovery to these directories. With none, scan the whole workspace (the working directory and any added directories).
- **Focus:** free text such as "security, perf". Treat it as the user's Gate 2 priority answer and don't ask that question again.
- **`--delegated`**, or a calling prompt from `/audit:all` that includes an inventory and Gate 2 answers: run in delegated mode as the contract describes.

## Scope

**In scope:** anything that ships code to a browser. That includes SPAs, SSR and meta-framework apps (Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Remix/React Router, Astro, Angular SSR, …), server-rendered templates with their own JS/CSS bundles, web components, micro-frontends, browser extensions, the web layer of hybrid apps (Capacitor, Ionic, Electron renderer), and UI component libraries or design systems consumed by those apps, including Storybook.

**Out of scope:** backend services, infrastructure, Node CLIs, lambdas, and pure static-site docs. Record each one you excluded with a one-line reason. When the same package holds server and browser code (e.g. Next.js route handlers), audit the browser side and the boundary (what leaks to the client), not the server logic.

## Phase 1: Discover

Don't assume how many repos there are or where they live.

1. Read root-level docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README*`, `docs/`) for a stated repo or app list. Treat it as a hypothesis to check.
2. Find the repositories (`.git` dirs, nested or side by side) and workspaces (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `workspaces` in `package.json`, `nx.json`, `turbo.json`, `lerna.json`, `rush.json`). Treat each workspace package as its own unit.
3. Find front-end markers, skipping `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `vendor`, and other generated dirs:
   - `package.json` depending on a UI framework (`react`, `vue`, `@angular/core`, `svelte`, `solid-js`, `preact`, `lit`, `qwik`, `next`, `nuxt`, `@sveltejs/kit`, `astro`, `@remix-run/*`, `ember-source`, …) or a browser build tool (`vite`, `webpack`, `rspack`, `parcel`, `esbuild`, `rollup`, `turbopack`).
   - Framework config files (`angular.json`, `vite.config.*`, `next.config.*`, `nuxt.config.*`, `svelte.config.*`, `astro.config.*`, `webpack.config.*`), `index.html`, `manifest.json` for extensions, and template dirs with bundled assets.
4. For each unit, collect: path, framework and version (from the lockfile, not the range), language and version, package manager and lockfile, build tool, test runner(s), lint/format tooling, CI config, rough size (`git ls-files` counts of source and test files), and last commit date.

**Gate 1.** Show the inventory table plus the excluded list, then ask with AskUserQuestion:

- Is this inventory complete and correct? (Yes / Some are missing or wrong, tell me which)
- Which units have priority? (All equally (Recommended) / Prioritise some, name them)
- Which branch or environment is production? (The current branch (Recommended) / Another, name it)

## Phase 2: Stack baseline

For each distinct stack (framework + major version):

1. Pin down the details: framework major, language version, TypeScript config, build tool, package manager, test and E2E runners, lint/format stack, CI system, CSS/UI framework, state management, data-fetching/HTTP layer, routing, i18n, auth client, observability/RUM SDKs, feature flags, and private or internal packages (scoped names, `.npmrc` registries).
2. Research current best practice **with web search, not memory**, for that exact major version: support and EOL status (with dates), idiomatic patterns for the version, deprecated APIs and their replacements, recommended lint rules and plugins (including accessibility rules), recommended test tooling, and recommended build settings such as budgets. Prefer official docs, release notes, and endoflife.date. Cite the source and date for each. If web search is unavailable, follow the contract's fallback.
3. Write a one-paragraph "what good looks like" baseline per stack. Measure the Phase 3 findings against this baseline, not against a generic checklist.

**Gate 2.** Ask with one AskUserQuestion call. Skip any question already answered by `$ARGUMENTS`.

1. **Priority.** "Which matters most?" Options: Security first, with the default order (Recommended) / Performance and UX first / Test quality first / Accessibility first. The default order is security → dependencies → accessibility → tests → performance → architecture → tooling. Move the chosen dimension to the front.
2. **Commands.** "What may I run?" Options:
   - Static only: read code, lockfile audits, no installs (Recommended)
   - Also install deps (scripts off) and run lint + unit tests
   - Full: install, lint, unit tests, and production build
   - Explain in Other which repos are unsafe or slow, and any private-registry auth needed.
3. **Depth.** "How deep?" Options: Deep on the top 2–3 units, survey the rest (Recommended) / Broad survey of all / Deep on all.
4. **Steering.** "Known pain points, incidents, or out-of-scope areas?" Options: None, proceed (Recommended) / Yes, describe them in Other.

Defaults if skipped: the default order, static only, deep on the top 2–3 by size and recency, nothing excluded.

## Phase 3: Audit each unit

Work through the dimensions in the user's priority order. For each check, record what you looked for, how (command or search), what you found, and the severity and confidence. Grep patterns are starting points. Confirm every hit by reading it in context before calling it a finding.

### Security

- **DOM/HTML sinks** for the stack: `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `document.write`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`, `{@html}`, `[innerHTML]`, `bypassSecurityTrust*`, `eval`, `new Function`, string `setTimeout`, `javascript:` URLs. For each hit, trace whether the input can be user- or server-controlled and whether it is sanitised (and with what).
- **Auth and tokens:** where tokens live (memory, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, cookie flags `HttpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite`), how they are attached to requests, the refresh flow, whether logout clears everything, and CSRF handling for cookie auth.
- **Secrets and environments:** keys or tokens in source, `environment*.ts`, `.env*` that are committed, and public-prefixed env vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_`, `REACT_APP_`) holding things that must not reach the client. Also server-only modules imported into client bundles.
- **Third-party code:** runtime-loaded scripts and SDKs, CDN tags without Subresource Integrity, CSP presence and strictness (`unsafe-inline`, `unsafe-eval`, wildcards), other security headers set by the app or its hosting config, `target="_blank"` without `rel="noopener"`, `postMessage` listeners without an origin check, and open redirects in routing or query handling.
- **Production leakage:** source maps, debug flags, verbose logging, devtools enabled, and mock/test endpoints shipped in production config.
- **Privacy:** PII sent to analytics, logs, or error reporting (session replay masking, breadcrumb scrubbing), and whether consent gating is wired up if the app uses tracking.
- **Reachable dependency CVEs**, cross-referenced from the Dependencies dimension.

### Dependencies and supply chain

- **Vulnerabilities:** lockfile-only audit. Split direct vs transitive, prod vs dev, and fixable-by-bump vs not. Rank by reachability in browser code, not raw count.
- **Support windows:** framework, language, build tool, and Node version against upstream EOL dates (cite them).
- **Health:** deprecated packages, packages with no release in 3+ years, duplicate libraries doing one job (two date libs, two HTTP clients, two state libs), unused dependencies (imports vs manifest), and heavy libraries with lighter, tree-shakeable alternatives.
- **Hygiene:** lockfile committed and in sync with the manifest, a single package manager per repo (`packageManager` field, mixed lockfiles), the version pinning strategy, `overrides`/`resolutions` and why they exist, and packages with install scripts.
- **Internal packages:** pins of shared/private libraries, and whether the registry config could allow dependency confusion (unscoped internal names, no scoped registry mapping).

### Accessibility

- **Tooling:** accessibility lint rules (`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, `vuejs-accessibility`, `@angular-eslint/template` accessibility rules, `svelte` a11y warnings) are enabled and not suppressed, and automated checks (axe, Testing Library role queries, Lighthouse CI, Pa11y) run in tests or CI.
- **Code patterns:** images without `alt`, form controls without labels, click handlers on non-interactive elements without role and keyboard support, positive `tabindex`, `outline: none` with no focus replacement, ARIA misuse (roles that conflict with native semantics, `aria-hidden` on focusable elements), missing `lang`, heading-order and landmark gaps in layouts, and modals or menus without focus management.
- **Design system:** whether the shared components are accessible by construction, since one broken primitive multiplies across every app. Check colour tokens for contrast where they are defined in code.
- **Motion and media:** `prefers-reduced-motion` support, captions for video.

### Test quality

- Test-to-source ratio, and which areas have **no tests**: routing, guards/middleware/interceptors, data-fetching services, forms and validation, state stores, and auth flows.
- Skipped or focused tests (`xit`, `xdescribe`, `.skip`, `.only`, `fit`, `test.todo`), tests with no assertions, and snapshot-only tests on logic.
- Mocking: whether the HTTP layer and timers are mocked consistently (MSW, `HttpTestingController`, fake timers), whether tests hit real services, and whether test setup is shared or copy-pasted.
- Coverage: whether a threshold exists, whether CI enforces it, and its value.
- Flakiness signals: real `setTimeout`/`sleep` waits, configured retries, order dependence, and quarantined tests.
- E2E and component tests: tool, location, whether they run in CI and on what trigger, and how they are gated.
- With permission, run the unit suite and report pass/fail/skip counts and wall time.

### Performance

- **Build output** (with permission): production build, entry/initial bundle size, number of lazy chunks, and the largest modules. Check whether budgets are configured (`budgets`, `size-limit`, bundlesize, `performance.hints`) and enforced.
- **Code splitting:** routes and heavy widgets loaded eagerly that could be lazy, and barrel files defeating tree-shaking.
- **Rendering**, against the version baseline: change-detection or reactivity patterns the version advises against, missing memoisation where profiling would matter, large lists without virtualisation or stable keys, and hydration or SSR anti-patterns (client-only data fetching on SSR pages, hydration mismatches, oversized serialised state).
- **Leaks:** subscriptions, listeners, intervals, observers, and sockets that are never torn down.
- **Network and assets:** request waterfalls, missing caching for static assets, unoptimised images (no responsive `srcset`, modern formats, dimensions, or lazy-loading), fonts without a `font-display` strategy or preloading, and whole-library imports where a subpath import exists.
- **Monitoring:** whether Web Vitals/RUM is reported and whether front-end errors reach an error tracker with source maps uploaded privately.

### Architecture and maintainability

- **Structure:** boundaries between features, shared code, and design system; circular imports; very large components or modules (list the top offenders by line count).
- **State and data:** one clear approach per concern; server state cached and invalidated deliberately; no ad-hoc global singletons.
- **Error handling:** error boundaries or route-level error UI, user-facing handling of failed requests, and loading and empty states.
- **Type safety at the edges:** API response types generated from or validated against the contract, or hand-written and drifting.
- **i18n:** a consistent approach, hard-coded user-facing strings, and locale-aware dates and numbers.
- **Dead code:** components, routes, services, styles, and feature flags with no references.

### Tooling and developer experience

- **Lint:** config present, consistent across repos, run in CI, count of disabled rules, and count of inline suppressions (`eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, `noqa`-style).
- **Formatter:** config committed and enforced in CI or a hook. Pre-commit hooks present.
- **TypeScript strictness:** `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, and framework template type-checking (`strictTemplates`, `vue-tsc`, `svelte-check`), plus counts of `any`, `as unknown as`, and non-null assertions.
- **Scripts:** standard names (`dev`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`) work and do the same thing across repos. Node version pinned (`.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `engines`, `packageManager`) and matching CI.
- **CI:** what runs on PR vs on merge, dependency caching, whether lint, typecheck, test, and build all gate merges, and whether workflows are copy-pasted and drifting between repos.
- **Docs accuracy:** compare the commands and architecture documented in README and agent docs with the code, and list every mismatch.

## Phase 4: Cross-repo consistency

Skip this phase if there is only one unit. Otherwise compare all units on: framework and language versions, shared-library pins, package manager, CSS/UI framework, lint/format config, TypeScript strictness, CI workflow shape, test runner and coverage thresholds, accessibility tooling, auth/token handling, data-fetching approach, i18n, and observability. Flag every place where two units solve the same problem differently, and name the better baseline and why.

## Phase 5: Report

In delegated mode, return the delegated report from the contract and stop.

Otherwise report **in chat only**. Write no files in the repo. Keep it under about 2,500 words, in this order:

1. **Headline:** three sentences: overall health, the single most serious issue, and the single cheapest high-value fix.
2. **Inventory:** the confirmed table, updated with anything learned.
3. **Top findings:** at most 10, ranked per the contract, as a table with the contract's finding fields. Keep each cell to one line.
4. **Per-unit summary:** at most 5 bullets per unit, covering what isn't already in Top findings.
5. **Clean:** one line per clean dimension: "Clean: checked X, Y, Z."
6. **Cross-repo drift:** a dimension × unit table where units differ, with the recommended baseline.
7. **Quick wins:** findings with Effort S, as a checklist.
8. **Could not verify:** skipped checks, why, and what it would take.
9. **Open questions for the team.**

Finish by deleting your scratch directory. Then offer to save the full report, including all findings beyond the top 10, to a file outside the repo, or to turn the top findings into tickets. Do neither unless the user asks.
